# finca-remake
This is a remake and redesign of finca.org - please check out their website.

# the why
This website was shown to me in my Web 115 class (web design II) and since I started learning to use materialize 
recently, i decided what better way to flex my CSS skills than to remake/redesign with materialize. Gotta
keep those CSS skills strong

# the how
just materialize, some javascript but this is mostly a quick fun project to sharpen my css
and the fact that i need more in my portfolio!
